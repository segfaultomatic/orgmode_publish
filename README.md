# Orgmode publish

# About

Project to generate HTML site from orgmode notes. My goal is to provide a simple means to publish my dev notebook (and possible parts thereof) is a simple one-step process. I want it outside of emacs IDE.

There are some examples of other folks doing this. I've put together a publish.el script based on the initial publish HTML tutorial from the worg docs:
https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.ht

And a bash script that drives emacs in batch mode.

# Next Steps
Make the source and destination directories configurable and modifiable at run time.
